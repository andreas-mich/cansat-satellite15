Satellite15 is a team from the third European School of Brussels participating in the CanSat 
2021-2022 competition

What is CanSat?
CanSats in Europe is an initiative of the European Space Agency (ESA), which also supports national CanSat events with the help of local organisations. 
These organisations are collaborating to increase the support for CanSat activities in Europe.
A CanSat is a simulation of a real satellite, integrated within the volume and shape of a soft drink can. 
The challenge for the students is to fit all the major subsystems found in a satellite, such as power, sensors and a communication system, into this minimal volume. 
The CanSat is then launched to an altitude of a few hundred metres by a rocket or dropped from a platform or captive balloon and its mission begins: 
to carry out a scientific experiment and achieve a safe landing.
CanSats offer a unique opportunity for students to have a first practical experience of a real space project.
They are responsible for all aspects: designing the CanSat, selecting its mission, integrating the components, testing, preparing for launch and then analysing the data.

Our aim:
In the beginning ‘Satellite 15’ was destined to become a probe or a vehicle 
that would allow us to calculate the speed of the rocket during its ascent. Nevertheless, this 
project was never implemented. We quickly adapted thought and continued this project with 
the same goal, finding alternative ways to measure the speed of this rocket. The new method 
consists of using a pitot tube and hydraulics to calculate the velocity of the CanSat. Our 
secondary mission would allow us to collect and compare scientific data. In addition, we would 
like to compare the data collected by the pitot tube and the data collected by our accelerometer. 
This would allow us to compare the data of a more traditional instrument and of a digital one.

Why did we choose this secondary mission?
During our physics class we studied waves and the Doppler Effect. This sparked our interest 
in the topic and therefore we started researching more. At the same time, we were informed 
about the CanSat competition, and we were eager to apply with this mission. However, after 
listening to our coach’s advice, we were on the look for an alternative experiment. We 
concluded that the best option was the Pitot Tube!
